Early-suspend
=============

The early-suspend api allows drivers to get notified when user-space writes to 
/sys/power/request_state to indicate that the user visible sleep state should 
change. A level controls what order the handlers are called in. Suspend 
handlers are called in low to high level order, resume handlers are called in 
the opposite order. 

Four levels are defined:
EARLY_SUSPEND_LEVEL_BLANK_SCREEN:
  On suspend the screen should be turned off but the framebuffer must still be
  accessible. On resume the screen can be turned back on.

EARLY_SUSPEND_LEVEL_STOP_DRAWING:
  On suspend this level notifies user-space that it should stop accessing the 
  framebuffer and it waits for it to complete. On resume it notifies user-space 
  that it should resume screen access.
  Two methods are provided, console switch or a sysfs interface.

EARLY_SUSPEND_LEVEL_DISABLE_FB:
  Turn off the framebuffer on suspend and back on on resume.

EARLY_SUSPEND_LEVEL_STOP_INPUT:
  On suspend turn off input devices that are not capable of wakeup or where
  wakeup is disabled. On resume turn the same devices back on.
